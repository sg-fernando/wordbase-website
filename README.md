# Website for Word Base Application (in progress)
Word Base is an educational app that combines the excitement of baseball with the learning of spelling. It is designed to help children improve their spelling and vocab skills in a way that is fun for them.

## App Features
* The player has to spell a word correctly or match a vocab word in order to run to the next base. A difficult word or a word that  the player has been having difficulty with will appear to make it from 3rd to Home base.
* The user will switch between different positions, such as batter or pitcher in order to keep the game engaging.
* The app will include its own library of words, but parents can also add custom words.
* Users may select which word libraries they want to use in a game.
## User Interaction and Gameplay
* The user will start by selecting the play button.
* They will start off as a batter.
* In order to hit the user will swipe at the correct moment based on the animation in order to hit the baseball after it is pitched (no spelling required so that users get a break from it)
* The amount of bases run will be based on spelling a word. 3+ mistakes will result in an out, 1+ gets you to first, and 0 mistakes to second.
* The user has the option to steal a base by spelling a word. If it is correct then they succeed but any mistake will cost them an out.
